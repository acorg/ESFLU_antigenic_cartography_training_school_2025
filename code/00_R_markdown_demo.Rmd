## R Markdown Demo

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

You can load packages that contain R functions, you can include code chunks like this:

```{r load_packages, echo=FALSE}
# Package names
packages <- c("knitr", "tidyverse")

# Install packages not yet installed
installed_packages <- packages %in% rownames(installed.packages())
if (any(installed_packages == FALSE)) {
  install.packages(packages[!installed_packages])
}

invisible(lapply(packages, library, character.only = TRUE))

#set ggplot2 theme
theme_set(theme_bw() + 
            theme(strip.background.x = element_blank()))
```


You can read in data that is saved in csvs like this:

```{r read_data}
demo_data <- read.csv("../data/titerdata/01_artificial_titerdata.csv")
```

Here, `read.csv()` is a function that performs an operation on its argument. The argument is the filepath to the csv file, which 
the function reads in and stores in the `data` object. The `<-` is a standard R assignement operator.

You can write your own functions like this:

```{r sum_function}

# function_name, assignment operator, declaration that this is a function with (argument 1, argument 2). The 
# function body is encapsulated by "{}" and the return() statement tells the function what to give back when it is called
sum_up <- function(par1, par2){
  
  result <- par1 + par2
  
  return(result)
}

```

You can then call the function like this:

```{r}
sum_up(4, 9)
```

You can also pass vectors, indicated to R by a `c()` to the function:

```{r}
sum_up(c(1:3), c(1, 2, 3))
```

We will be using the `ggplot2` package for plotting, which takes a data frame as `data` argument, followed 
by aesthetic arguments, such as which column to take as x and y axis, in the `aes()` block. Finally,
you need to tell ggplot what kind of plot you want, e.g. scatterpoints or lines:

```{r}
ggplot(data = demo_data, aes(x = X, y = serum_A)) + 
  geom_point()
```
